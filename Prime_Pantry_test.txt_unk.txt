Rating: 5. <unk> a very <unk> <unk> to write a product review on a <unk> item. <unk> <unk> grocery items our <unk> already <unk> what we want and what we like to buy.

Rating: 3. <unk> I like the cereal, I <unk> that you only get <unk> boxes for $<unk> <unk>. <unk> is over $6 each for a small box of cereal. I have found it for much less at local grocery stores.
Rating: 3. <unk> so this cereal is <unk> I <unk>, but the <unk> is so small you can <unk> have 3 <unk> per box.
Rating: 5. <unk>, like <unk>? <unk> with <unk> and <unk> <unk> so <unk>! <unk> of <unk> in <unk> can.

Rating: 5. Great product at a great price!
Rating: 5. I have been ordering for years and eat a few every <unk>...
Rating: 5. This is a good product. I will definitely be ordering more.
Rating: 5. I bought a few <unk> and they didn't last long. I had tried a <unk> of different <unk> <unk> and <unk> and this is by <unk> the best and the favorite of the house. <unk> <unk> but these are worth the <unk> if you can <unk> them.
Rating: 5. Great product! This <unk> left my hands <unk> <unk> and <unk> after the <unk> use. I also like that it has a <unk>, <unk> <unk> that is not <unk>.
Rating: 4. <unk> our house, we make a lot of <unk> drinks, and have <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> tonic brands, <unk> several of the premium <unk>. We've tried: <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> (<unk> <unk> store brand), <unk>, <unk>'s, Canada Dry, Hansen's. <unk> tonics pair best with different gins, and the value has to be <unk>, <unk> that some tonics can cost <unk> more than others per <unk>. There is always a value <unk> when <unk> drinks, and you need to <unk> the total cost of cocktails, especially if you have drinks <unk>, or <unk> a lot of <unk> <unk>. <unk> of the options (<unk>, <unk> Tonic are good <unk>) can be really <unk> at ~$2 per 6. 8oz bottle; that <unk> to get a little <unk> per drink. <unk> two cocktails each for a <unk> of <unk> <unk> has added $<unk> in tonic water to your <unk>. The premium tonics are worth <unk> <unk> to <unk> with, and can be great options for " <unk> " cocktails, but they also have to be <unk> <unk> with the right gin to really <unk> out their <unk>. (<unk>, a little more of a <unk> gin, is a nice <unk> for them <unk>, and it's a <unk> gin that is an excellent value.) For <unk> drinks, our go-to tonic is Hansen's. It's <unk> <unk> in our area at <unk> <unk> stores for ~$3 per <unk> of 8oz <unk>, so ~$0. <unk>/can. 8oz is enough to make two G&Ts, and the flavor profile pairs really well with Hendrick's, our <unk> G&T gin. Hendrick's is a <unk> gin with a <unk> <unk> profile that pairs best with a <unk>, less bitter tonic. This is <unk> Hansen's <unk>. <unk> a <unk> of two of <unk>, depending on your <unk> (<unk> is a favorite, <unk> is <unk> good <unk>), and you've got one of the best G&Ts you've <unk> <unk>. If you'<unk> using New Amsterdam, as one of the <unk> <unk> mentioned, then Hansen's is NOT the right gin. New Amsterdam is the best <unk> for a value gin. In our area, it's 1/3 the cost of Hendrick's. We keep it on the <unk> for use in several other cocktails, but <unk> use it in a G&T. It's sweet and <unk> and <unk> a bitter tonic to pair with it. For the <unk> in tasty, <unk> G&Ts, pair New Amsterdam with Canada Dry Tonic. They pair well, with the bitter <unk> of Canada Dry <unk> the <unk> of the New Amsterdam, and you can make G&Ts for as little as $0. <unk>/each, depending on the cost of <unk> in your area. <unk> line, Hansen's is an excellent <unk> for a <unk> tonic water. <unk> don't write it <unk> just because it <unk>'t <unk> the gin in your <unk>; different gins need different tonic waters to really <unk>. <unk> on your tastes and your <unk> in cocktails, you may want to keep several different tonic waters on <unk> for different <unk>. <unk>.

Rating: 5. I have tried <unk> battery brands over the years and found Energizer to be the best when it <unk> to quality and dependability. <unk> batteries I have tried <unk> <unk> brands like Duracell and <unk> brands such as Kirkland Signature (<unk>). These other battery brands have been a <unk>! The <unk> reason is that they leak alkaline. Normally this <unk> when batteries are <unk> or have <unk> installed long after losing their charge. I have experienced these <unk> with Duracell batteries that had NEVER been installed and were NOT <unk> than the date printed on the battery <unk>. <unk> that this was an <unk> <unk>, I purchased additional Duracell batteries and had the same <unk>. Since then, I have not purchased Duracell batteries.

All four batteries were Kirkland Signature brand and installed at the same time. The date printed on the batteries was " <unk> <unk> ". <unk> to that date, the batteries should <unk> fresh for at <unk> the <unk> four years. The toy still <unk> and each battery, when <unk> <unk>, still had a charge. The toy was a <unk> <unk> that not been <unk> to <unk> <unk>, <unk>, or any other <unk> <unk> which <unk> <unk> the alkaline leak. I have NEVER experienced this with Energizer batteries. Normally, I use rechargeable batteries. However, with children toys, I use regular alkaline batteries since children <unk> and <unk> toys. A <unk> toy is bad enough. However, losing four rechargeable <unk> batteries installed in it is like losing an additional $<unk>. <unk>, I don't feel <unk> having my children around batteries that leak alkaline. Kids are <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> their <unk>/hands in their <unk>, <unk>, <unk>. I feel that there is a <unk> safety <unk> with leaking batteries. For safety, dependability, and quality <unk>, I have <unk> to purchase Energizer alkaline batteries <unk> when I'<unk> not using rechargeable batteries. I <unk> that my experiences may <unk> from others. However, the negative experiences I've had were not <unk> <unk>. This review is not <unk> to <unk> other brands. <unk> negative experiences mentioned <unk> other brands are <unk> so in order to <unk> the <unk> <unk> them and Energizer batteries. I hope this review is <unk>.
