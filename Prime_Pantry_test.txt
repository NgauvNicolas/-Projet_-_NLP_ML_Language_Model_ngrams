Rating: 5. Its a very unique task to write a product review on a foodstuff item. When purchasing grocery items our family already knows what we want and what we like to buy. So a pantry box will be filled with products that we buy on a regular basis. This product is no different. High quality product, great taste and a constant staple at our house.
Rating: 3. Though I like the cereal, I notice that you only get six boxes for $38 dollars. That is over $6 each for a small box of cereal. I have found it for much less at local grocery stores.
Rating: 3. ok so this cereal is delicious I admit, but the packaging is so small you can maybe have 3 bowls per box.
Rating: 5. Eh, like Spam? Nice with eggs and rice Oh so ono! Lots of aloha in da can.

Rating: 5. I bought a few bags and they didn't last long. I had tried a bunch of different dried fruits and berries and this is by far the best and the favorite of the house. Little pricey but these are worth the treat if you can afford them.
Rating: 5. Great product! This soap left my hands feeling soft and moisturized after the first use. I also like that it has a light, clean scent that is not overpowering.
Rating: 4. At our house, we make a lot of mixed drinks, and have intentionally sampled most of the widely distributed tonic brands, including several of the premium offerings. We've tried: QTonic, FeverTree, Stirrings, 365 (Whole Foods store brand), Seagrams, Schwepp's, Canada Dry, Hansen's. Different tonics pair best with different gins, and the value has to be weighed, considering that some tonics can cost 30x more than others per oz. There is always a value equation when making drinks, and you need to consider the total cost of cocktails, especially if you have drinks often, or host a lot of dinner parties. Some of the options (Fevertree, Q Tonic are good examples) can be really expensive at ~$2 per 6.8oz bottle; that starts to get a little steep per drink. Suddenly two cocktails each for a group of 7-8 friends has added $20-30 in tonic water to your evening. The premium tonics are worth buying once to experiment with, and can be great options for "artisinal" cocktails, but they also have to be carefully paired with the right gin to really bring out their strengths. (Citadelle, a little more of a citrus-y gin, is a nice companion for them both, and it's a mid-shelf gin that is an excellent value.) For everyday drinks, our go-to tonic is Hansen's. It's readily available in our area at Harris Teeter stores for ~$3 per six-pack of 8oz cans, so ~$0.50/can. 8oz is enough to make two G&Ts, and the flavor profile pairs really well with Hendrick's, our preferred G&T gin. Hendrick's is a top-shelf gin with a complex cucumber profile that pairs best with a lighter, less bitter tonic. This is where Hansen's excels. Add a drop of two of bitters, depending on your mood (rhubarb is a favorite, celery is another good option), and you've got one of the best G&Ts you've ever tasted. If you're using New Amsterdam, as one of the previous reviewers mentioned, then Hansen's is NOT the right gin. New Amsterdam is the best choice for a value gin. In our area, it's 1/3 the cost of Hendrick's. We keep it on the shelf for use in several other cocktails, but seldom use it in a G&T. It's sweet and citrusy and needs a bitter tonic to pair with it. For the ultimate in tasty, cheap G&Ts, pair New Amsterdam with Canada Dry Tonic. They pair well, with the bitter notes of Canada Dry complimenting the sweetness of the New Amsterdam, and you can make G&Ts for as little as $0.60/each, depending on the cost of liquor in your area. Bottom line, Hansen's is an excellent value--especially for a cane-sweetened tonic water. But don't write it off just because it doesn't match the gin in your cabinet; different gins need different tonic waters to really shine. Depending on your tastes and your interest in cocktails, you may want to keep several different tonic waters on hand for different occasions. Cheers.
Rating: 3. These leave a strange after-taste in your mouth. I am a big fan of Teddy Grahams and thought I would give these a try because they were listed in the amazon marketplace. Was disappointed.

Rating: 1. Very, very sweet, with a poor texture that tastes like puffed, sugary, air. With so many other great choices for gluten free bars & treats on the market now, I can't imagine why anyone would buy this stuff for their kids. In my view this is gluten free junk food -- organic , or not.
Rating: 5. I have purchased many large boxes of baking soda in the past, but here was my chance to get a good price on an even-larger bag. I use soda in place of any laundry additives for whitening and brightening. Sprinkle 1/2 cup onto your clothes, prior to starting the laundry wash cycle - and watch how your brights and colors (and whites!) come out of the wash JUST GLOWING! Want to keep your whites WHITE? This product is a great laundry brightener, and all natural, using NO CHEMICALS on your clothing.
Rating: 3. I don't know what it is but theses noodles have a different taste to them... Maybe like a cinnamon taste? They are not bad but not my favorite.

Rating: 5. These are yummy! Kids love them and not as sugary as some snacks out there.

Rating: 5. Since I drink a lot of coffee and tea, I prefer a toothpaste that helps to avoid stains from either one. This Colgate Whitening paste does a good job of eliminating the problem. It has a pleasant mild taste. I also like the easy to unwrap container. The plain white bottle is neat and unobtrusive on my vanity. It stands upside down so that the toothpaste is always ready to put on the brush, even when there is only a bit left in the bottle. The semi-transparent bottle also makes it easy to see how much is left.
Rating: 1. Whoever packed this order packed everything together all of my groceries were smashed and my carpet freshener had exploded and covered everything so half of my order has to be thrown away.

Rating: 5. I have tried numerous battery brands over the years and found Energizer to be the best when it comes to quality and dependability. Other batteries I have tried include major brands like Duracell and generic brands such as Kirkland Signature (Costco). These other battery brands have been a disappointment! The main reason is that they leak alkaline. Normally this occurs when batteries are old or have remained installed long after losing their charge. I have experienced these leaks with Duracell batteries that had NEVER been installed and were NOT older than the date printed on the battery itself. Believing that this was an isolated incident, I purchased additional Duracell batteries and had the same outcome. Since then, I have not purchased Duracell batteries. I recently noticed that one of my children's toys had a white powdery coating developing around the battery compartment. After opening the compartment, I observed two of the (four) batteries were leaking alkaline. All four batteries were Kirkland Signature brand and installed at the same time. The date printed on the batteries was "MAR 2018". According to that date, the batteries should remain fresh for at least the next four years. The toy still worked and each battery, when individually tested, still had a charge. The toy was a two-way radio that not been exposed to extreme temperatures, moisture, or any other conceivable factor which could cause the alkaline leak. I have NEVER experienced this with Energizer batteries. Normally, I use rechargeable batteries. However, with children toys, I use regular alkaline batteries since children misplace and lose toys. A lost toy is bad enough. However, losing four rechargeable AA batteries installed in it is like losing an additional $15. Additionally, I don't feel comfortable having my children around batteries that leak alkaline. Kids are constantly touching things and placing their fingers/hands in their mouths, eyes, etc. I feel that there is a real safety concern with leaking batteries. For safety, dependability, and quality reasons, I have chosen to purchase Energizer alkaline batteries exclusively when I'm not using rechargeable batteries. I understand that my experiences may differ from others. However, the negative experiences I've had were not one-time occurrences. This review is not intended to berate other brands. Any negative experiences mentioned involving other brands are done so in order to establish the difference between them and Energizer batteries. I hope this review is helpful.
Rating: 5. I can't believe this cereal only has 5g of sugar! I expected this cereal to be bland and tasteless when I bought it, but it turned out to be perfectly sweet and does not taste like cardboard. It is crispy and sits well with milk without getting too soggy. I also enjoy snacking on it on its own! In my opinion, this cereal tastes better than other brands like Kashi, whose cereals just scream "healthy" when you eat it. I am also a fan of its other flavors such as Peanut Butter and Cinnamon, but this one is definitely my go-to!
Rating: 5. Very fresh and tasty I prefer them over peanuts zi give them 5 stars

Rating: 5. These Black Beans by Westbrae are awesome. The beans are not mushy and have a great flavor. As a bonus, you shouldn't have to worry about chemicals and sprays in your food so Westbrae went through the hassle of finding Organic Beans to be able to label their product USDA Organic. The liner of the can is BPA free to give you even further peace of mind. Westbrae Brand is my new favorite brand of canned beans and I hope you will find them as good as I have.
Rating: 5. Good snack for the little ones.
Rating: 5. Delish! They were tender and sweet, just as they should be. I have had nothing but positive experiences with Newman's products (which surprises me for some reason). I have ordered these several times now and they are great. I wish my local market carried them!
Rating: 5. Product arrived on time and as expected.
Rating: 4. Crunchy is right. These totally satisfy my afternoon craving for a little crunch without any added sugar. Just one ingredient: apples. I hate how other brands feel the need to add sugar. Fruit already is sweet and has enough sugar naturally. the only complaint i have with these is that the bag is really small. It's only 2 servings. a little overpriced in my opinion, but since there aren't a lot of good options, i will likely continue to purchase.
Rating: 5. Item received is as item described
Rating: 1. I do not like it at all
Rating: 3. The quality has gone down hill. There are not as many whole nuts as there were the last time I purchased them. One can get them from Trader Joes for cheaper with better quality. Probably won't buy again.

Rating: 5. I was always told that you should never use the same shampoo and Conditioner on your hair, that you should mix it up a little. Use different brands. So here is my journey I do. And this is one that I use and my hair loves me. So i don't use hairspray, or mouse in my hair. I curl it and I blow dry it every now and then. And my hair behaves.
Rating: 5. Good item, fast shipping. Easy transaction. Thank you very much! A+++++++
Rating: 5. Excellent value. Excellent taste. If I have to use sugar, this is what I want to use. The bag is resealable, but didn't trust it with the Florida heat, humidity and bugs so got a big canister to keep it. It has larger crystals than refined white sugar, but that hasn't stopped me from using in nearly every recipe that calls for sugar, especially if its dissolved anyway. Great bang for my buck.
